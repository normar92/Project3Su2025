Team Name - Project 3 Group 3
● Team Members - Norma Marin, Vincent Zvolsky, Illia Karbivnychyi
● Project Title - Project 3 - Group 3 Library
1. Problem: We are trying to solve the problem of people being unable to
filter through large collections of books.
2. Motivation: Often, large amounts of books are compiled into datasets
that are impractical and inefficient for people to browse through.
3. Features: Features will include search/drop down menus to filter/sort by
numerous categories (key word, genre, year, etc.). Button to switch
between data structures. We know that we have solved the problem
when we have a program that allows non-tech-savvy users to easily and
efficiently traverse a large library of books.
4. Data: Books

et-2023-130k-books
5. Tools: We will be using C++, github, maybe a PowerBI, and Excel tool to
organize and cleanse the data.
6. Visuals:
7. Strategy: We will use 2 data structures, a hash table and a red-black
tree, to store book information and allow the user to filter/sort by fields
such as title, author, genre, year released, and possibly more.
Preliminary data structures and algorithms include: class to store book
objects, sort and search algorithms
8. Distribution of Responsibility and Roles:
● Norma will be coding the Hash Table and shrink the dataset to the
100k suggested record count.
● Vincent will be coding the Red-Black tree and its functions.
● Illia will be parsing the input and building the UI.
